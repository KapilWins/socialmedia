To get YouTube API key

1. Log in to Google Developers Console.
   You can log in to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard using your Google account. If you don’t yet have one, you’ll need to create one.

2. Create a new project.
   Once you log in, you’ll automatically be taken to an empty dashboard. On the upper right-hand corner, click Create Project. You’ll be taken to a screen where you can add a project name, select your organization, and select a location (URL). You can create a project without an organization. If you don’t have an organization, you won’t be prompted to select a location. Once you create a project, everything you do from here onwards, including creating the API key, will apply to that specific project. If you have multiple projects going at the same time, ensure that the correct one is selected by double-checking that the project is listed on the top navigation bar.

3. On the new project dashboard, click Explore & Enable APIs.
   After creating a project, you’ll be taken to a brand new dashboard with different cards: Project Info, Resources, and so on. Navigate to the Getting Started card and click on Explore & Enable APIs.
   Alternatively, on the sidebar, navigate to APIs & Services > Library.

4. In the library, navigate to YouTube Data API v3 under YouTube APIs.
   Once you’ve reached the library, you’ll see a page divided into sections.
   Navigate to the section titled YouTube APIs and select YouTube Data API v3.
   Alternatively, you can search for the YouTube Data API on the search bar.

5. Enable the API.
   After you arrive at the YouTube Data API page, click a blue button with the word Enable.

6. Create a credential. After clicking Enable, you’ll be taken to an overview page.
   On the top right corner, click Create Credentials.
   On the Credentials window, select YouTube Data API v3 for the first blank space, Web server (e.g. node js. Tomcat) for the second, and check the Public data box on the third prompt.
   Right below that, click on the blue button titled What credentials do I need?
   After that, your API key will automatically load.
   Click Done.

7. A screen will appear with the API key.
   Finished! You’ve got your API key.
   It’s saved in your credentials for easy retrieval.
